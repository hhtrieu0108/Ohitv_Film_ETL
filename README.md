# This is a project that I want to try 2 ways to crawl data.
- ## `Selenium`
- ## `Request API`

# What I do :
- Crawl data from a `website` named `Ohitv.net`
- Convert to `dataframe` includes : 
    - `title`	: title of the film
    - `links`	: link of the film
    - `date`	: date that the film published
    - `rating` : rating score of film
    - `quality` : quality of film
    - `genre`	: genre/kind of film
    - `short_description` :  a short description of film
- Finally import to database `Postgres` (Request API) or `SQL Server` (Selenium)

# If you have any idea or question. Just contact me. I always want to learn from you
